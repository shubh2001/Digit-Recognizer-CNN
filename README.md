# Digit-Recognizer-CNN

`Digit Recognizer` is a competition on Kaggle which gives a overall introduction to neural networks. 
**Problem Statement**: In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.
MNIST dataset is given to us. The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.

Lenet-5 architecture is used for our deep learning model. 
Frameworks used:
* Tensorflow version  2.6.0
* Keras
